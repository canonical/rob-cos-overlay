# Terraform module for MicroCeph

This is a Terraform module facilitating the deployment of the `microceph` charm,
using the [Terraform Juju provider](https://github.com/juju/terraform-provider-juju/).
For more information,
refer to the provider [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/juju/juju/latest/docs).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This module requires a Juju K8s model to be available.
> Refer to the [usage section](#usage) below for more details.

> [!NOTE] This module temporarily lives here until the microceph charm provides its own.

## Usage

Users should ensure that Terraform is aware of the `juju_model` dependency of the charm module.

To deploy this module with its needed dependency, you can run:

```bash
terraform apply -var="model=<MODEL_NAME>"
```
